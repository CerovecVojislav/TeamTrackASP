# TeamTrackASP

## Introduction:
TeamTrackASP is a simple application developed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern in ASP.NET. This project does not rely on a database and instead uses in-memory data storage.

## Project Structure:
The project follows the MVC pattern, which separates the application into three main components:

1. **Model:** Contains the data and business logic of the application. In this project, the employee model is responsible for defining the structure and behavior of employee objects.
2. **View:** Handles the presentation layer of the application. The views in this project display employee information and provide user interfaces for interacting with the data.
3. **Controller:** Acts as the intermediary between the model and view components. Controllers handle user input, update the model accordingly, and update the view to reflect the changes.

## Project Dependencies:
To run this ASP.NET application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Visual Studio: The project was developed using Visual Studio, so having it installed will simplify the process.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub or extract the project files to a local directory.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio by navigating to the project directory and opening the solution file (.sln).
3. Build the solution to ensure all the necessary dependencies are resolved.
4. Set the "MVC_Employee" project as the startup project.
5. Run the application using the debugging feature in Visual Studio by clicking on the "Start" button or by pressing F5.

## Using the Application:

1. Upon running the application, a web browser will open, presenting you with a user interface to manage employee records.
2. Use the provided options and forms to add employees, view employee details, update employee information, or delete employee records.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the necessary information or select the desired options.
4. The application will display appropriate messages and updates based on your inputs and actions.
5. To stop the application, close the web browser or stop the debugging session in Visual Studio.

## Notes:

- The application stores employee records in memory, so any data you add or modify will be lost once the application is stopped or restarted.
- This project serves as a basic example of implementing the MVC pattern in ASP.NET without a database. It can be extended and customized to meet specific requirements, such as integrating a database or adding additional functionality.
- For any questions or issues regarding the project, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers or the original author.
